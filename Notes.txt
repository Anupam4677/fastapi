Tech stack
 - Python-3.10.0 , FastApi,Postgres,SQLAlchemy

Setting up the virtual Env :
- py -3 -m venv <name>  (name it venv- no prob as its isolated for this project)
- Select the correct interpreter 
- venv\Scripts\activate.bat  - terminal also uses the same env
- pip install fastapi[all]
- pip freeze - shows all the packages which are installed 

Start Wedserver
- uvicorn main:app --reload (main.py is the file name )

Why we need schema
- It is a pain to get all the values from the body 
- The client can send whatever data they want 
- The data is not GettingValidated 
- we ultimately want to force the client to send the data in a schema that we expect 
Library 
- we make use og the library pydantic
- Pydantic has nothing to do with fast API,
- seperate libray can be used with any other application
